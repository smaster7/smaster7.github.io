I'm currently an assitant professor at Department of Artificial Intelligence, Inha University.
I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Seoul National University in 2020.
My research area focuses on developing deep learning models and machine learning for analyzing graph-structured data and multi-omics data.
The major goal of my works is an interpretation of biological mechanisms of living organisms, and a modeling molecular graph incorporating subgraphs and 3D information.
<!--
I has involved in several bioinformatics-tool development projects such as
an interpretable deep learning model, subpath mining, sequence similarity measurement, and multi-omics integration.
