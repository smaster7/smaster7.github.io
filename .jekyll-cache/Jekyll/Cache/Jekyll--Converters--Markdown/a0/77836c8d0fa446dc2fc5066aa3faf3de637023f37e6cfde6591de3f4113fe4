The Multi-Attention based Deep Learning model aims to learn regulatory latent space of epigenetic/transcriptional markers such as histone modifications, methylations, and transcription factors.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embedding different epigenetic/transcriptional markers into a regulatory latent space using marker-specific architectures such as CNN &amp; RNN with attention (histone modification), RNN with attention (methylation), self-attention network (transcription factor).</li>
    <li>Integrating each latent feature by multi-attention block to interpret relationships between multiple regulatory features.</li>
    <li>In experiments with 18 cell lines, the proposed model predicted the gene expression level more accurately than the state-of-the-art model.</li>
    <li>Reveal the cell-type-specific gene regulation mechanisms and enriched genes in terms of their functions and epigenetic regulation.<br />

The pathway attention model is an explainable deep learning model for predicting cancer subtyes using gene expression data and biological pathways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capturing localized gene expression patterns in pathways by graph convolutional networks (GCNs)</li>
    <li>Reproducing biological mechanisms by combining results of GCN with multi-attention based ensemble</li>
